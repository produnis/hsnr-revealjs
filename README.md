# HSNR-themed Revealjs Extension For Quarto

A [quarto extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) featuring an HSNR-inspired theme for the [reveal.js format](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).

See the included [template.qmd](template.qmd) file for an example of the theme and integration into Quarto or explore the rendered version [here](http://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/hsnr-revealjs/).

For details on how to convert from a single-themed document into a Quarto Extension for RevealJS see [PR #1](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/hsnr-revealjs/pull/1)

## Installing

You can obtain a copy of the extension by using:

```bash
quarto use template produnis/hsnr-revealjs
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that
you can use as a starting place for your presentation slides.

## Using

Once the extension is installed, you can use the extension by setting the `format` inside of the document header to `hsnr-revealjs`.
